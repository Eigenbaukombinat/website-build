currently there are the following possibilities in the Eigenbaukombinat at about 700m²:

* the **wooden workshop** is the best equipped workshop. from the band saw to the lamello milling cutter to the decoupling saw you will find here (almost) everything you need for wood processing. for those who like it more modern, a CNC milling is available.
* the **metal workshop** offers, in addition to a flex and numerous hand tools, a CNC milling machine for aluminium as well as an MIG-MAG welding workstation, a metal band saw and a large stand drilling machine.
* in the **bicycle workshop**, besides mounting and centering stand, there are enough tools to be able to separate and reassemble its bike. besides the sandblasting cabin and associated compressor, there are also many spare parts and used wheels for use in the camp.
* in the area **3D printing** there are various 3D printers for various tasks. next to our ultimaker also an X400.
* **Electronics** fans are also on their cost. for electronics projects are solder stations, labor network parts, oscilloscopes and some other tools available. a large electronic range keeps some common (and unusual) spare parts ready.
* the range **wool and sew** includes, in addition to normal household sewing machines, a satt learning sewing machine by singer, with which shoe soles, truck tarpaulin and leather can be sewn. In addition, we also have an industrial sewing machine from Dürkopp-Adler, which offers sufficient reserves for thick materials and extensive sewing work.
* the **Photo-VR-Studio** is equipped with a background system, lighting and three studio flashes including softboxes. we still have a VR glasses and some audio technology. with one of our mobile beamers we can also watch cinema films here.
* the **AudioVideo** range has backgrounds to provide LED video duration light, a 4k camera and a matching calculator. we can also produce audio here and music with various electronic clips and synthesizers.
* the **dark chamber** has everything you need to develop black and white analog photos. various exposed and photo paper from different decades invite to experiment!
* in the field of **model construction**, we offer two laser cutters and a paint booth (even in remodeling).
* in the **library** there are intessant books and magazines about themes relevant to the building, e.g. woodworking, handwork in general or programming. there are also our expenses of make!
* the **garden** is next to the **social room & kitchen** a central element for exchange and offers almost infinite possibilities for events. also the **forge** is built up regularly when it comes to hot forming of steel.
* in our **ceramic area** is about ton deformation. thanks to the loan of a large pottery disc and a fire oven that is specially created thanks to the means of transport, we can now start with it.
* in the [**screen printing workshop**](/neuer-bereich-siebdruckwerkstatt/) an extensive equipment is available to convert your own motivides from the bare seven to the finished shirt.
* **culture** is a new area, where in future readings, presentations and general inter-area and intercombination theme evenings will be developed and offered, which are of course open to all. who wants to get here is welcome!



We also have many other tools and machines, such as a cutter or an enamelling oven, which are accommodated in the various workshops and are waiting for their use.
